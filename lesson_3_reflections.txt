When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    As backup and for collaboration.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I want to be in control to decrease chance of code conflicts.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Cone - local copy of a repository to work on and periodically synch with the GitHub version.
    Branch - new code or bug fix to be to be merged with master branch after testing or verification.
    Fork - a copy of a repository to experiment with.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Can use latest code; less chanch of code conflicts, when making changes. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Nothing is easier without version control.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

  Always with code. A separate branch allows for testing w/o affecting production code version.
